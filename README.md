# Faith Wafula – DevPortfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio site, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)! This project showcases my journey from analytical chemistry to machine learning development, with a strong focus on ethical AI and fair system design. It’s a space to explore my work, values, and vision for a more transparent and inclusive future in tech.

This site is based on the **DevPortfolio Template** originally created by [Ryan Fitzgerald](https://x.com/rfitzio). It’s been tailored to reflect my experiences, projects, and beliefs — and rebuilt from the ground up to support easy configuration and personal branding.

You can find the original template [here](https://ryanfitzgerald.github.io/devportfolio/).
